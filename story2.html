  <p> After 60 years, the legacy of the Brooklyn Hurricanes has come to an end. The youth tackle football league has seen a drop in registration due to concerns around head injuries. </p>

  <p> Steve Orr, president of the Hurricanes, announced in October that this will be the final season of the league due to a drastic drop in registration. Five years ago, the league consisted of nine teams with about 210 total players. This year, there were three teams with about 70 total players.</p>

  <p>Michael Barbieri, executive director of the Downtown Giants, a youth football league based in Brooklyn, recently merged the Giants with the Brooklyn Hurricanes to help both leagues survive. However, now that the Brooklyn Hurricanes are finishing their final season, he does not know if the Giants will be able to continue either.</p>

  <p>“I don’t know what the future holds,” Barbieri said. </p>
  <blockquote> “I don’t know what the future holds," said Michael Barbieri, executive director of the Downtown Giants.</blockquote>

  <p> Barbieri said while participation in tackle football has dropped, participation in flag football – which doesn't involve tackling – has increased. </p>

    <p>This is reflective of a larger trend. While about five million people played tackle football across the country in 2017, about six million played flag football, according to the Sports & Fitness Industry Association. The graph below shows overall participation in both over the past five years. Since just 2016, participation in tackle football has descreased by 16 percent, while participation in flag football has increased by 12 percent. </p>
