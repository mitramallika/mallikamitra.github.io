<p>Free college was a big talking point during this year’s midterm elections, but experts say we need to change the way we talk about going tuition-free.
</p>

<p>Last year, The Institute for College Access and Success published a report showing that the even a very lost cost can be unaffordable for students with few resources while a very high price may be manageable for students with more resources.</p>

<p>“We absolutely do a disservice and it leads us to the less effective policy solutions when our lens is focused on tuition and fee levels,” said the institute’s Director of Policy and Planning Jessica Thompson. “A better thing to look at is net price – the total cost of attendance minus grant aid.”</p>

<blockquote>“We absolutely do a disservice and it leads us to the less effective policy solutions when our lens is focused on tuition and fee levels," said the institute’s Director of Policy and Planning Jessica Thompson.</blockquote>

<p> The map below shows the percent of people with student debt in each state and the net college prices for families with an income of $30,000 or lower in those states. It also shows the average student debt a person in that state has as well as the lowest 2018-2019 in-state tuition.</p>
