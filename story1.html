<p> New Yorkers have many opportunities to enjoy classical music in the evenings. But free, midday concerts? Those are harder to come by.</p>

  <p>Now, on the first Wednesday of every month, Juilliard students will perform classical music from well-known composers at The Greene Space, a studio in lower Manhattan. The free series, Midday Masterpieces, comes from National Public Radio’s (NPR) classical music station WQXR. With a more relaxed approach than classical music lovers might be used to, the series has kicked off its third season, which runs from September to May. It is also streamed live by WQXR.</p>
  <p>“We wanted to make sure we were throwing the doors open to as many people as possible,” said Matt Abramovitz, vice president of programming at WQXR. “We first called them ‘lunchtime concerts’ and wanted people to come in with their brown bags and eat during their lunch breaks.”</p>
  <p>Abramovitz said, the “lunchtime concerts” name was dropped after the series’ first season, when they found people were so engrossed in the music, they didn’t eat.</p>

  <p>On September 12 violist Jordan Bak and pianist Ji Yung Lee took the stage for the first performance of the season to perform compositions by Astor Piazzolla, Georg Philipp Telemann and Johannes Brahms. Roughly 120 audience members listened intently, some with closed eyes, others closely following the performers’ movements.</p>

  <p>The free concerts are aimed at a different audience than the regular music goers evening concerts tend to draw. They also offer Juilliard students a chance to practice performing live.</p>

  <p>
    “A lot of our events were evening events,” Abramovitz said about WQXR’s concerts. “But there are lots of ways to spend evening hours. We wanted to mix it up and see what kind of audience we would draw.”

  <p>Cathy Dale, a retired business manager for an HIV/AIDS education center from Manhattan, has attended every concert in the series.</p>

  <p>“I don’t take advantage of concerts at night because I’m usually asleep,” Dale said, who is in bed most evenings at 9 p.m. “This breaks up my day well.”</p>

  <blockquote> “This breaks up my day well.” </blockquote>

  <p> The Midday Masterpieces series also brings classical music to those who might not usually listen to the genre.</p>

<p>That was the case for Willie Wong, a retired staffer of the United Nations, who attended his first Midday Masterpiece concert in September. </p>

<p> “I always go to these to try new things and listen to music I wouldn’t necessarily otherwise listen to,” Wong said. </p>

<p>Jordan Bak, the 24-year-old violist, said he finds The Green Space to be a more laid back environment than other concert venues he’s attended because New York City’s streets are so visible from the studio, which may play a part in why the series seem accessible. </p>

<p>“It doesn’t have to feel so formal,” Bak said about classical music concerts. “It’s nice at The Green Space. I found it’s a more welcoming place to give midday concerts.”</p>

<blockquote> “It doesn’t have to feel so formal." </blockquote>

<p>Abramovitz said WQXR is exploring how they can make classical music even more accessible through the Midday Masterpieces series. This year, they will work with public schools to bring students from across New York City to the concerts.</p>
